# Full API integration

Method 1:
1. At boot request ENG hero list + user language hero list
2. When a hero is added to the user's roster request to the API additional data for that character (camping + skills) and store them with users heroes list (slightly slower than  the current local database method)
3. During calculation use the data stored on user's side

note: if the data is updated on EpicSeven DB the user has to remove and add the character again to make the changes effective

some Hero icons are missing on EpicSevenDB

Method 2:
Require all the data during boot -> longer startup time

Method 3:
1. Use a bot to commit to master branch and update database everytime a change is made to the API
2. Load the file at boot with $.getJSON("heroDatabase.json", function(json) {console.log(json);});

Data must be encoded in Base64
Better user experiance, no loading times
